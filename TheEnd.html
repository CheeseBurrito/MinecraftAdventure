            <h1>The End</h1>
            <p>Returning to the Overworld, you quickly find the stronghold. You enter the portal room only to realize that the portal already had all the Eyes of the Ender, rendering your trip to the Nether redundant. With a sigh and a chuckle, you enter the portal.</p>
            <p>The Ender Dragon may be the end boss of the game, but it is no match for an experienced player like you. You defeat it without breaking a sweat.</p>
            <p>Congratulations! Youâ€™ve completed the game in the shortest time possible! However, there is a way to beat the game with fewer moves.</p>
