            <h1>Dig Straight Down</h1>
            <p>Minecraft doesn’t technically have rules, but not digging straight down is about how close it gets. But not to worry, you and your rebel mindset are better than petty rules.
            </p>
            <p>So you dig straight down, and find a cave! With a 42-block drop straight down… you die. Doesn’t look like you’ll be doing that ever again.</p>
