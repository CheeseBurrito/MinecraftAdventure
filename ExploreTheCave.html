            <h1>Explore the Cave</h1>
            <p>You explore the cave, going deeper and deeper, collecting an endless amount of resources. Gold, diamonds, emeralds, coal, and even redstone are flooding your inventory. Youâ€™ve spent what seems like hours (5m, 43.42s) in this cave. But as you mine another diamond, you ask yourself, is this enough?</p>
            <a href="Starved.html" class="leftalign"><h3 class="OptionButton">Yes</h3></a>
            <p class="leftalign">Dig straight up, and see where you end up</p>
