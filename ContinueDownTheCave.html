            <h1>Continue Down The Cave</h1>
            <p>So you continue down for what seems like forever (5m 2.358s) until you strike the greatest treasure of all: the Stronghold.</p>
            <p>You enter the stronghold and find something that shocks you even more: A fully completed end portal. The probability of a completed end portal is less than 1 in a trillion. So you enter the portal</p>
            <p>The Ender Dragon may be the end boss of the game, but it is no match for an experienced player like you. You defeat it without breaking a sweat.</p>
            <p>Congratulations! Youâ€™ve completed this choose your own adventure in the shortest moves possible! However, there is a path that completes the speedrun in a shorter amount of time.</p>
